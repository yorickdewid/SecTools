Description
===========
A modular tool written in bourne shell and designed to chain and automate
security tools and tests. It parses target definitions from the command line and
runs corresponding modules afterwards. sn00p can also parse a given nmap logfile
for open tcp and udp ports. All results will be logged in specified directories
and a report can subsequently be generated.
