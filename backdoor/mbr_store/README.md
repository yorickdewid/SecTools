Description
===========
This tool stores up to 426 bytes in the MBR's bootloader code section of unused
devices such as usb drivers, hrd disks (which are not supposed to boot) and
other media. GRUB detection is implemented for safety reasons, Windows
bootloader code will be shamelessly overwritten. ;)
